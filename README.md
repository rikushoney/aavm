# ARM Assembler and Virtual Machine

This directory and its sub-directories contain the source code for AAVM - an
assembler for universal assembler language (UAL) and a virtual machine to
execute the generated bytecode.

## Getting started

AAVM uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to configure the sources for builds. An
example workflow could be:

1. Get the sources:

   * ``git clone https://github.com/rikushoney/aavm.git``

2. Configure and build AAVM:

   * ``cd aavm``

   * ``mkdir build && cd build``

   * ``cmake -G <generator> ..``

      where generator can be any of:

      * ``Ninja`` (recommended for Linux users)

      * ``Unix Makefiles`` (if you are familiar with traditional "Makefile"s)

      * ``Visual Studio`` (recommended for Windows users)

      * ``Xcode`` (recommended for OSX users)

   * ``cmake --build .``

3. If compilation succeeded the resulting binaries should be present in the bin
directory
